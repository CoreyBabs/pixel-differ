# Pixel Differ

This repo contains all implementations for a pixel differ written in different languages. This is a project I do to learn a new language because it has IO, concurrency and
UI/CLI.

Pixel Differ does a pixel wise diff or corruption on an image based on a collection of images. This is based on https://github.com/okiyama/pixel-matcher.

# Requirements

1. Allow the user to pick their own image.
2. Allow the user to pick their own child images (with a provided default).
3. Allow the user to save the result as a gif or video.
4. Have a single threaded and concurrent solutions.
5. Have a cli or GUI or both depending on the language.

# Optional

6. Use hardware acceleration
7. Try different optimizations, algorightms, thresholds etc.
8. Add more features.
